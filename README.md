# Vehicle Management System
Welcome to the Vehicle Management System project! This C++ application is designed to manage vehicle records, including information such as vehicle make, model, year, registration details, and maintenance history. With this system, organizations or individuals can efficiently track and maintain their fleet of vehicles, ensuring optimal performance and compliance with regulatory requirements.

## Features
1. **Vehicle Registration:** Allows users to register new vehicles into the system by entering their details such as make, model, year, VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), registration number, and ownership information.

2. **Vehicle Maintenance Tracking:** Enables users to record and track vehicle maintenance activities such as oil changes, tire rotations, inspections, repairs, and servicing, ensuring that vehicles are properly maintained and serviced according to schedule.

3. **Fuel Consumption Monitoring:** Provides functionality to monitor fuel consumption for each vehicle, including fuel type, fuel efficiency, fuel costs, and mileage tracking, allowing users to analyze fuel usage patterns and identify cost-saving opportunities.

4. **Insurance and Registration Renewal Reminders:** Generates reminders for insurance renewal, registration renewal, and other important deadlines, helping users stay compliant with regulatory requirements and avoid penalties.

5. **Reporting and Analytics:** Generates reports and analytics on vehicle usage, maintenance costs, fuel consumption, and other key performance indicators (KPIs), providing insights for decision-making and cost optimization.

6. **User Authentication and Authorization:** Implements user authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the system and ensure data security and privacy.

## Installation
To set up the Vehicle Management System:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/RadinaAvramova/vehicle-management-system.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd vehicle-management-system

3. **Compile the Code:** Compile the C++ source files using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++):

g++ -o vehicle_management main.cpp vehicle.cpp maintenance.cpp fuel.cpp

4. **Run the Application:** Execute the compiled executable file to start the application:

./vehicle_management

## Usage
1. **Register New Vehicles:** Users can register new vehicles into the system by providing their details such as make, model, year, VIN, registration number, and ownership information.

2. **Record Maintenance Activities:** Users can record maintenance activities for each vehicle, including oil changes, tire rotations, inspections, repairs, and servicing, along with dates, costs, and service provider information.

3. **Monitor Fuel Consumption:** Users can monitor fuel consumption for each vehicle, recording fuel type, fuel efficiency, fuel costs, and mileage tracking to analyze fuel usage patterns and optimize fuel expenses.

4. **Set Reminders:** Users can set reminders for important deadlines such as insurance renewal, registration renewal, and scheduled maintenance, ensuring timely action and compliance with regulatory requirements.

5. **Generate Reports:** Users can generate reports and analytics on vehicle usage, maintenance costs, fuel consumption, and other KPIs, providing insights for decision-making and cost optimization.

## Customization
1. **Vehicle Categories and Types:** Customize the system to support different categories and types of vehicles, such as cars, trucks, vans, and buses, with specific attributes and maintenance requirements.

2. **Custom Fields and Data:** Allow users to define custom fields and data attributes for vehicle records to accommodate specific organizational requirements or industry standards.

3. **Integration with External Systems:** Integrate the Vehicle Management System with external systems such as fleet management software, GPS tracking systems, and accounting software for seamless data exchange and interoperability.
